Driver for SPD1656 driven ACeP (7-color) e-paper displays.

Please note that we do not have Blinka support for this yet. So it won't work with a Raspberry Pi.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.

This supports the common 4" and 5.65" ACeP displays.

* [Waveshare 4"](https://www.waveshare.com/4.01inch-e-paper-hat-f.htm)
* [Waveshare 5.65"](https://www.waveshare.com/5.65inch-e-paper-module-f.htm)
* [Pimoroni 5.7"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-5-7) (Likely the same as 5.65".)
* [Pimoroni 4"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-4)

Installing from PyPI
=====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-spd1656/>`_.
To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-spd1656

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-spd1656

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-spd1656

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install adafruit_spd1656

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============

.. code-block:: python
